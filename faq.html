    <h4>Overview Answers</h4>
    <h5>What are CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™?</h5>
    <p>CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™ are fabric technologies added to our market-leading brands to create the next generation of healthcare apparel. CERTAINTY™ incorporates antimicrobial technology*, while CERTAINTY PLUS™ includes the antimicrobial plus a fluid barrier by NANOTEX® that repels liquids. </p>
    <a name="q2"></a>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <h5>How does the antimicrobial technology in CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™ work?</h5>
    <p>CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™ medical apparel uses a technology developed by DOW Chemical Company called SILVADUR™ that reduces, inhibits and minimizes the growth of bacteria on the fabric*. As opposed to scrubs without antimicrobial protection, the technology of CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™ delivers silver ions to fabric surfaces, where they are activated in the presence of undesirable bacteria. When the undesirable bacteria come into contact with treated fabrics, the growth of the bacteria is disrupted and the bacteria are continually reduced. SILVADUR™ technology ensures that unpleasant odors, decay and discoloration don't occur in fabrics by preventing bacteria from forming or growing.</p>
    <a name="q3"></a>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <h5>How does CERTAINTY PLUS™ work?</h5>
    <p>CERTAINTY PLUS™, which uses the technology Resists Spills by NANOTEX®, enhances products through the use of nanotechnology – tiny molecules permanently attach to fibers without clogging the fabric weave or compromising the look, feel or comfort of the fabric. CERTAINTY PLUS™ builds revolutionary spill resistance into the fibers of the fabric, fundamentally transforming each fiber so that liquids bead up and roll off. CERTAINTY PLUS™ features include:
    	<ul class="classicList">
        	<li>Repels liquids</li>
            <li>Outperforms conventional fabric treatments</li>
            <li>Provides long-lasting fabric protection against spills and stains</li>
            <li>Extends the life of the fabric</li>
            <li>Retains the fabric’s natural softness</li>
            <li>Allows fabric to breathe naturally</li>
         </ul>
    </p>
    <a name="q4"></a>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <h5>What makes CERTAINTY PLUS™ products different from other fabric enhancements?</h5>
    <p>Traditional coatings make garments feel stiff and clog the weave of the fabric preventing breathability. Our treatment uses nanotechnology to attach to individual fibers, delivering superior performance characteristics without compromising the look, feel or comfort of the fabric.</p>
    <a name="q5"></a>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <h5>How is the fluid barrier technology of CERTAINTY PLUS™ applied?</h5>
    <p>CERTAINTY PLUS™ fluid barrier fabric technology is applied prior to the manufacturing of the garment. It can be pad applied in fabric form or can be dipped or spray applied in garment form.</p>

    <h4>Fabric Care Answers</h4>
    <!--<a name="q14"></a>
    <h5>How do garments with CERTAINTY PLUS™ get clean in the laundry if they repel liquids?</h5>
    <p>CERTAINTY PLUS™ provides protection from a wide range of liquid spills and stains. Fabric treated with CERTAINTY PLUS™ is not waterproof, but instead water resistant. CERTAINTY PLUS™ changes the surface tension of fabrics, so liquids bead up and roll off the fabric; it does not affect nor hinder the ability of the fabric to be cleaned through a normal home laundry process. While the fluid barrier repels an unwanted liquid, the garment, when put into a washing machine, can still be saturated with the detergent and water that will clean the garment during the laundry process.  
	</p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>-->
    <h5>What are the recommended cleaning instructions for garments made with CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™?</h5>
    <p>CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™ are designed to stand up to real life; simply wash the garment as you would any other, following the care instructions provided on the care label. For CERTAINTY PLUS, tumble-drying with heat is required, and steam ironing will enhance performance. Liquid softeners and dryer sheets are not recommended for CERTAINTY PLUS™ fabrics. Dry cleaning is allowed, however, the technology will perform better on garments that are machine washed.</p>
    <!--<a name="q13"></a>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <h5>If the garments have a liquid blocking technology, how do they get clean when laundered?  </h5>
    <p>The combination of detergent and agitation in the water causes the repellency technology to go dormant, allowing the fabric to get wet and clean. When the garment is put in the dryer, heat re-activates the technology so that it repels again.

    <h4>Safety Answers</h4>
    <h5>Is the antimicrobial safe for me and my family?</h5>
    <p>Yes. SILVADUR™,  developed by DOW and used in CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™, has been tested extensively both by DOW scientists and independent third-party experts. The polymer technology is fixed to the textile surface, where it activates only in the presence of unwanted bacteria on the garment. CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™ won’t irritate your skin and won’t wash out or rub off, when used appropriately.</p>
     <a name="q17"></a>
     <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <h5>Will the antimicrobial technology in CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™ irritate my skin?</h5>
    <p>The issue of skin sensitivity is paramount with any change that we make to our textiles. We are very aware of this issue, and DOW has performed extensive testing, not only on the raw ingredient (which is all that is required by the EPA), but also on the treated garments. An extensive study on sensitivity and the effects of repeated contact with fabrics treated at almost 7x the recommended level of CERTAINTY™ showed there were no "untoward effects." </p>
     <!--<a name="q18"></a>
     <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <h5>Do the antimicrobial properties discriminate between ‘good’ bacteria and ‘bad’ bacteria?  If not, does the person wearing the scrub potentially lose their infection-fighting bacteria and become more susceptible to infection?
	</h5>
    <p>The question about "good and bad" bacteria is important to understand. On our skin, we have a significant amount of bacteria that act as one of our first lines of defense in our body’s immune system. They create an environment in which unhealthy (bad) bacteria cannot exist, and are considered "good" bacteria. In no way do we want the antimicrobial agent to come off the treated textile, get onto the skin and kill these "good" bacteria. This is one of the unique features of the CERTAINTY™ fabric. The active ingredient is essentially fixed to the textile surface. The CERTAINTY™ fabric only kills/prevents the growth of the bacteria that are trying to grow/survive on the surface of the garment where the "bad" bacteria are located. </p>-->
     <a name="q19"></a>
     <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <h5>Do the technologies in CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™ have an impact on the environment?</h5>
    <p>The  technology behind CERTAINTY™ and CERTAINTY PLUS™ has silver atoms held within its molecules, so that only silver ions are released at the fabric’s surface to fight odor-causing bacteria. Silver particles are not released into the environment. Plus, the silver used in CERTAINTY™ comes from recycled sources and is not mined.</p>
     <a name="q20"></a>
     <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
      
    <h5>Are CERTAINTY PLUS™ products PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) free?</h5>
    <p>Yes. NANOTEX®, the technology behind CERTAINTY PLUS™ took a leadership position in 2006 by being one of the first companies to introduce a C6-based "PFOA free" repellency solution, Resists Spills, to the market. PFOA-free denotes that there is no detection of PFOA using the most sensitive testing equipment available.</p>
