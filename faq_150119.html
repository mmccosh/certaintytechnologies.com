    <h4>Overview Answers</h4>
    <a name="q1"></a>
    <h5>What are Certainty and Certainty PLUS?</h5>
    <p>Certainty and Certainty PLUS are fabric technologies added to our market-leading brands to create the next generation of healthcare apparel. Certainty incorporates antimicrobial technology, while Certainty Plus includes the antimicrobial plus a fluid barrier by NANOTEX® that repels liquids. </p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
	<a name="q2"></a>
    <h5>How does Certainty work?</h5>
    <p>Science and innovation combine to create Certainty antimicrobial technology, the intelligent antimicrobial that keeps textiles fresh and odor-free. When unwanted bacteria come into contact with treated fabrics, silver ions are released and the bacteria are eliminated. Unlike particle based silver technologies that release both ionic silver AND silver laced particles into the surrounding area, Certainty antimicrobial only releases silver ions at the surface. </p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <a name="q3"></a>
    <h5>How does Certainty PLUS work?</h5>
    <p>Certainty PLUS, which uses the technology Resists Spills by NANOTEX®, enhances products through the use of nanotechnology – tiny molecules that permanently attach to fibers without clogging the fabric weave or compromising the look, feel or comfort of the fabric. Certainty PLUS builds revolutionary spill resistance into the fibers of the fabric, fundamentally transforming each fiber so that liquids bead up and roll off. Certainty PLUS features include:
    	<ul class="classicList">
        	<li>Repels liquids</li>
            <li>Outperforms conventional fabric treatments</li>
            <li>Provides long-lasting protection</li>
            <li>Extends the life of the fabric</li>
            <li>Retains the fabric’s natural softness</li>
            <li>Allows fabric to breathe naturally</li>
         </ul>
    </p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <a name="q4"></a>
    <h5>What makes Certainty PLUS products different from other fabric enhancements?</h5>
    <p>Traditional coatings make garments feel stiff and clog the weave of the fabric preventing breathability. Using nanotechnology, our treatments are small enough to attach to individual fibers, delivering superior performance characteristics without compromising the look, feel or comfort of the fabric.</p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <a name="q5"></a>
    <h5>How is the Certainty PLUS enhancement applied?</h5>
    <p>Certainty PLUS antimicrobial and fluid barrier enhancements are applied prior to the manufacturing of the garment.</p>

    <h4>Effectiveness Answers</h4>
    <a name="q6"></a>
    <h5>Will the antimicrobial protection last as long as the product?</h5>
    <p>Yes. The polymer containing silver technology binds to the matrix of the fabric. It’s been tested extensively and will last for more than 50 washings or for the expected life of the fabric or product, when used appropriately. </p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <a name="q7"></a>
    <h5>What is the efficacy of properly treated products?</h5>
    <p>Independent, third party microbiological laboratories have confirmed that samples properly treated with the Certainty antimicrobial technology demonstrate greater than 99% bacterial reduction even after 50 home launderings. </p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <a name="q8"></a>
    <h5>Will the fluid resistance technology last for the life of the garment? </h5>
    <p>Certainty PLUS products are engineered to provide exceptional durability and will perform for the expected life of the fabric or garment.</p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <a name="q9"></a>
    <h5>Does Certainty or Certainty PLUS change the feel of the fabric? </h5>
    <p>No. There is no change in hand or drape of Certainty treated garments compared to untreated garments.</p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <a name="q10"></a>
    <h3>Missing Is certainty plus effective against fluids answer </h3>
    <h5>Is Certainty PLUS effective against fluids?</h5>
    <p></p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <a name="q11"></a>
    <h5>Can you print on top of enhancement? </h5>
    <p>Yes. Certainty PLUS enhancements are compatible with heat transfer and screen-printing. Other types of fabric printing would need to be evaluated to determine success.</p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <h4>Fabric Care Answers</h4>
    <a name="q12"></a>
    <h5>Do I have to wash Certainty products any special way?</h5>
    <p>No. Since Certainty antimicrobial is designed to stand up to real life, just follow the garment’s care instructions. </p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <a name="q13"></a>
    <h5>If the garments have a liquid blocking technology, how do they get clean when laundered?  </h5>
    <p>The combination of detergent and agitation in the water causes the repellency technology to go dormant, allowing the fabric to get wet and clean. When the garment is put in the dryer, heat re-activates the technology so that it repels again.
	</p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
    <a name="q14"></a>
    <h5>How do garments with Certainty PLUS get clean in the laundry if they repel liquids?</h5>
    <p>Certainty PLUS provides protection from a wide range of liquid spills and stains. Fabric treated with Certainty PLUS is not waterproof, but instead water resistant. Certainty PLUS changes the surface tension of fabrics, so liquids bead up and roll off the fabric; it does not affect nor hinder the ability of the fabric to be cleaned through a normal home laundry process. While the fluid barrier repels an unwanted liquid, the garment, when put into a washing machine, can still be saturated with the detergent and water that will clean the garment during the laundry process.  
	</p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
	<a name="q15"></a>
    <h5>What are the recommended cleaning instructions for garments made with Certainty PLUS?</h5>
    <p>Wash the garment as you would any other garment, following the care instructions provided on the care label. Tumble-drying with heat is required. For optimal performance, steam ironing will enhance performance. Liquid softeners and dryer sheets are not recommended for Certainty PLUS fabrics. Dry cleaning is allowed, however, the technology will perform better on garments that are machine washed.

    <h4>Safety Answers</h4>
    <a name="q16"></a>
    <h5>Is the antimicrobial safe for me and my family?</h5>
    <p>Yes. Silvadur, the antimicrobial developed by Dow and used in Certainty, has been tested extensively both by Dow scientists and independent third-party experts. The polymer-containing silver technology locks the silver deep into the fabric matrix where it activates only in the presence of unwanted bacteria at the surface of the treated fabric. Certainty won’t irritate your skin and won’t wash out or rub off, when used appropriately.</p>
     <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
     <a name="q17"></a>
    <h5>Will Certainty antimicrobial irritate my skin? </h5>
    <p>The issue of skin sensitivity is paramount with any change that we make to our textiles, especially antimicrobial agents. We are very aware of this issue, and Dow has performed extensive testing, not only on the raw ingredient (which is all that is required by EPA), but also on the treated article. An extensive study on sensitivity and the effects of repeated contact with fabrics treated at almost 7x the recommended level of Certainty showed there were no "untoward effects." </p>
     <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
     <a name="q18"></a>
    <h5>Do the antimicrobial properties discriminate between ‘good’ bacteria and ‘bad’ bacteria?  If not, does person wearing the scrub potentially lose their infection-fighting bacteria and become more susceptible to infection?
</h5>
    <p>The question about "good and bad" bacteria is important to understand. On our skin, we have a significant amount of bacteria that act as one of our first lines of defense in our body’s immune system. They create an environment in which unhealthy (bad) bacteria cannot exist, and are considered "good" bacteria. In no way do we want the antimicrobial agent to come off the treated textile, get onto the skin and kill these "good" bacteria. This is one of the unique features of the Certainty fabric. The active ingredient is essentially fixed to the textile surface. It cannot come off and kill any bacteria on the skin. 
The Certainty fabric only kills/prevents the growth of the bacteria that are trying to grow/survive on the surface of the garment where the "bad" bacteria are located. </p>
     <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
     <a name="q19"></a>
    <h5>Is there an impact on the environment?</h5>
    <p>The polymer-containing silver technology fastens silver molecules to the fabric’s surface so that only silver ions are released to fight odor-causing bacteria. Silver particles are not released into the environment. Plus, the silver used in Certainty comes from recycled sources and is not mined. </p>
     <a href="#top" class="top">back to top</a>
      <a name="q20"></a>
    <h5>Are Certainty PLUS products PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) free?</h5>
    <p>Yes. NANOTEX®, the technology behind Certainty PLUS took a leadership position in 2006 by being one of the first companies to introduce a C6-based "PFOA free" repellency solution, Resists Spills, to the market. PFOA-free denotes that there is no detection of PFOA using the most sensitive testing equipment available.</p>
