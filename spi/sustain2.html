  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>A central element of SPI's overall mission is to <b>set the gold standard for sustainability in the apparel industry</b>. We are firmly committed to environmental responsibility, and this commitment is evidenced every day in all of our business dealings and practices with our employees, customers, vendors, suppliers and the community at large. We view all of these individuals and organizations as our partners in the pursuit of environmental responsibility.</p>
  <h2>Our Strategy</h2>
  <p>We are <b>continuously monitoring sustainability</b> as it relates to all internal and external aspects of our business, and we are committed to following a strategy that includes:</p>
 	<ul>
    	<li>Monitoring and upgrading all aspects of our Company's sustainable practices and performance, especially in terms of recycling, conserving energy and using resources efficiently and responsibly.</li>
        <li>Establishing challenging sustainable goals in all operational areas, and monitoring achievement in these areas on a regular basis.</li>
        <li>Regularly reviewing, assessing and upgrading sustainable practices in all departments, divisions and facilities.</li>
        <li>Communicating our policies, standards and expectations regarding sustainability to our employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and the community at large.</li>
        <li>Providing formal and informal training to help our employees understand their responsibilities in terms of sustainability.</li>
        <li>Using all communication channels to emphasize and recognize sustainable practices and outcomes.</li>
        <li>Working with elected officials, appropriate governmental agencies and local business organizations to learn about new sustainable developments and gain additional insight into innovative and creative sustainable programs.
</li>
    </ul>
 	<p>In addition to extensive sustainability programs at our corporate headquarters and Dallas Distribution Center, SPI works with our international suppliers to ensure sustainable manufacturing processes. We are partnering with our vendor community to continuously improve on various water treatment and energy saving efforts. These currently include:  </p>
	<ul>
    	<li>Reducing water use through the implementation of a recycling system that uses steam condensate as recycled water.</li>
        <li>Installation of water waste monitors and evaluation systems to reduce water usage.</li>
        <li>Replacing dyestuff chemicals with eco-friendly product and upgrading the waste water processing. All chemicals are certified by ITS. </li>
        <li>Recycling print screens as well as alkaline, dyestuff and auxiliaries.</li>
        <li>Reducing water waste emissions that include the selection of auxiliary and the increased use of non-salt auxiliaries. </li>
        <li>Registering with the BSI and operating an energy management system that complies with the standards of the GB/T23332-2009. </li>
        <li>Sewing factories use boilers that run on recycled variable fuel. </li>
        <li>The Company has partnered with several factories that have active programs for solar electricity. </li>
        <li>The factories that the Company uses have vents and fans, rather than costly/high energy air conditioning systems, to cool their buildings.</li>
        <li>These factories also have double-paned windows to reduce the use of energy for heat, as well as to insulate year round. </li>
        <li>Several factories have cost-saving/energy-saving underground heaters.</li>
        <li>As part of this process, box sizes are also reviewed, ultimately reducing the number of containers that are needed and resulting in fuel savings for transport.</li>
    </ul>
